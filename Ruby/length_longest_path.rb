# Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories.
# An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

# Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories,
# subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.

# In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

# dir
# ⟶ subdir1
# ⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
# ⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
# ⟶ subdir2
# ⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
# ⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
# If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.

# Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

# Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

# Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.

# Example 1:

# Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"
# Output: 20
# Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.
# Example 2:

# Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"
# Output: 32
# Explanation: We have two files:
# "dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
# "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
# We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.
# Example 3:

# Input: input = "a"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".

# Constraints:

# 1 <= input.length <= 104
# input may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character '\n', a tab character '\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and digits.
# All file and directory names have positive length.

# @param {String} input
# @return {Integer}
def length_longest_path(input)
  arr = input.split('\n')
  return 0 if arr.length <= 1

  res = [arr[0]]
  ans = 0

  (1...arr.length).each do |i|
    a = arr[i].split('\t')
    l = a.length - 1
    res[l] = a[-1]
    ans = [ans, res[0..l].join('/').length].max if a[-1].include?('.ext')
  end
  ans
